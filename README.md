* check the full procedure on [community.ui.com](https://community.ui.com/questions/UniFi-Installation-Scripts-or-UniFi-Easy-Update-Script-or-UniFi-Lets-Encrypt-or-UniFi-Easy-Encrypt-/ccbc7530-dd61-40a7-82ec-22b17f027776)

## IMPORTANT

These scripts were **not created by me**, they were developed by [Glenn Rietveld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenn-rietveld-555811149) from [Ubiquiti](https://www.ui.com/). I've only created this repository to make it easier to find the scripts and track their updates.
